Created in JavaScript with Phaser.js, this is my first endless arcade web game that I hope leaves you hungry for more!

Developed in 4 days with all original artwork, this was a passion project to practice JavaScript and FrontEnd development.



> TODO: Pretty up the UI.. 4 day development and 20 minutes UI really shows lol
